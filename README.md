It includes ad impressions, clicks, spend, demographic targeting, and conversion rates. The dataset encompasses multiple social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Twitter, providing diverse advertising campaign data.

## Tools

## Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Standardise data formats
3. Convert age range into discrete bins
   
## Exploratory Data Analysis 
EDA involves exploring the social media dataset to answer key questions such as;
- What is the campaign performance of a social media platform? 
- How is the Audience Segmentation? 
- What is the return on investment (ROI) for advertising campaigns?

## Findings
The analysis results are summarised as follows;
1. The most used social media platforms were Facebook and Instagram
2. Instagram had the biggest ROI with a higher engagement score
3. The health segment had the highest engagement

## Recommendations
1. Invest more in advertising on Instagram and Facebook
2. Focus on goods in the health, food, and fashion segments
   
## Limitations
- Where gender and age weren't specified and classified as other
- the analysis was based on a fictional database
